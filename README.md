# Bidirectional Path Tracing

## Introduction

This program provides a detailed implementation of a fundamental paper in rendering, focusing on Bidirectional Path Tracing (BDPT), Multiple Importance Sampling (MIS). The whole project is written in pure C++ based on the architecture of path tracing assignment from GAMES101 by Prof. Lingqi Yan (UCSB).

## Example

![BidirectionalPathTracing.ppm](images/BidirectionalPathTracing.png)

*Figure 1: Bidirectional Path Tracing, spp = 25.*

![PathTracing.png](images/PathTracing.png)

*Figure 2: Path Tracing, spp = 25.*

For comparison, the image in Figure 2 is generated by the Path Tracing algorithm, which is the basic algorithm for rendering. The image in Figure 1 is generated by the Bidirectional Path Tracing algorithm, which is an advanced algorithm for rendering. The Bidirectional Path Tracing algorithm can generate more realistic images with less noise.
## Tutorial

Create a build file folder in the directory:
```bash
mkdir build
```

Enter the build file folder:
```bash
cd build
```

Running cmake file:
```bash
cmake ..
```

Compile the project:
```bash
make
```

Run the project:
```bash
./BidirectionalPathTracing
```

An image file named `binary.ppm` would appear in the directory.

## Theory

### Bidirectional Path Tracing Architecture

#### Path Weight Calculation

For a path $x = x_0x_1x_2x_3x_4$:

$$ f_j(x) = L_e(x_0 \rightarrow x_1) G(x_0 \leftrightarrow x_1) f_s(x_0 \rightarrow x_1 \rightarrow x_2) G(x_1 \leftrightarrow x_2) f_s(x_1 \rightarrow x_2 \rightarrow x_3) G(x_2 \leftrightarrow x_3) f_s(x_2 \rightarrow x_3 \rightarrow x_4) G(x_3 \leftrightarrow x_4) W_e(x_3 \rightarrow x_4) $$

#### Unweighted Path

The unweighted contribution can be written as $C^*_{s,t}$:

$$ \frac{f_j(x_{s,t})}{p_{s,t}(x_{s,t})} \equiv \alpha^L_s c_{s,t} \alpha^E_t $$

#### Path Weights

Using power heuristic weights:

$$ w_k(p_s) = \frac{p_s^2}{\sum_i p_i^2} = \frac{1}{\sum_i \left(\frac{p_i}{p_s}\right)^2} $$

### Importance Flow and Radiance Flow

The light transport equation:

$$ L_o(x, \omega_o) = L_e(x, \omega_o) + \int_{S^2} L_o(M(x, \omega_i), -\omega_i) f_s(x, \omega_i \rightarrow \omega_o) d\sigma^\perp_x(\omega_i) $$

Importance transfer for sensors:

$$ W(x, \omega_o) = W_e(x, \omega_o) + \int_{S^2} W(M(x, \omega_i), -\omega_i) f_s(x, \omega_o \rightarrow \omega_i) d\sigma^\perp_x(\omega_i) $$

## Notice

This project is still under development. More features will be added in the future. And there might be still some bugs in the implementation of the BDPT algorithm.
